function [status,traj]=read_xtc(trajinit)
% [status,traj]=read_xtc(initstruct)
% Read an xtc or trr file and return tstep,ttime,tbox and tx
% initstruct - from inittraj()
% traj.step (int32) - step number
% traj.time (single) - time in ps
% traj.box (singlePtr) - Box as a 3x3 array, use traj.box.value to get the actual numbers
% traj.x (singlePtr) - Coordinates as a 3xnatoms array, use traj.x.value to access the coordinates
