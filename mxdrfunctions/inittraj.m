% [status,trajinit]=inittraj(file,action)
% Open a trajectory file with either libxdrfile. Returns a libpointer
% filehandle and the number of atoms in the existing trajectory file as
% fields in a struct variable:
% trajinit.handle
% trajinit.natoms
%
% file (str) - filename of xtc or trr file to open
% action (str) - r or w for read or write access
