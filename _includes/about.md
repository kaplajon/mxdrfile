# About mxdrfile

The mxdrfile wrapper functions were created with the aim of improving the abilities of fast trajectory analysis in Matlab. The library enables reading and writing of .xtc and .trr trajectory files through the use of the original <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/Developer_Zone/Programming_Guide/XTC_Library">xdrfile library</a> from the Gromacs team.

Both the latest version of the  xdrfile library and mxdrfile are open source and released under a BSD license.
