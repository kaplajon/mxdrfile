%%%%%%%%%%%% USING THE XDRFILE LIBRARY WITH MATLAB %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-- The libxdrfile lib was compiled with the following:

> export MXWORKDIR=$PWD
> tar xzvf xdrfile-1.1.4.tar.gz

-- The following patch fixes a buffer overrun bug reported here
   https://github.com/SimTk/mdtraj/issues/606
   The fix was posted on the gromacs mailing list
   by Robert McGibbon 2014-09-26.

> patch -p0 <fix_buffer_overrun_1.1.4.patch
> cd xdrfile-1.1.4
> ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$MXWORKDIR
> make
> make install

-- The header files for libxdrfile had to be slightly altered with a patch
   to be loadable into matlab. The altered files reside inside include/:

>cd $MXWORKDIR
>patch -p0 <headers.patch

-- The thunk library file and the fileheaders.m was created by running the
following command in matlab:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile','xdrfile_xtc.h','addheader','xdrfile_trr','addheader','xdrfile','mfilename','fileheaders.m',...
 'thunkfilename','libxdr_thunk')

The library can then be loaded with:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile',@fileheaders)

%%%%%%%%%%%%% TESTING THE LIBRARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The library read and write functions can be tested by running the included test scripts test_trr.m
and test_xtc.m in Matlab after completing the above install procedure.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% THE WRAPPER FUNCTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OPEN AND CLOSE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
--> FILE: inittraj.m

USAGE: [status,initstruct]=inittraj(fname,action)

fname - (str) Filename of .xtc or .trr file
action - (str) 'r' or 'w' for read or write access. WARNING! 'w' will overwrite fname!!
status - (int32)
initstruct:
    fhandle - (lib.pointer) XDR file handle
    natoms - (int32) Number of atoms in trajectory

--> FILE: closetraj.m
USAGE: [status,initstruct]=closetraj(initstruct)
        Warning! Operating on a closed lib.pointer
        file handle may cause segmentation faults. Make sure
        to "pass by reference" using initstruct as both
        input and output when closing trajectories!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% READ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

USAGE: [rstatus,trajstruct]=read_xtc(initstruct)

status - int32
trajstruct:
    step - (int32) timestep
    time - (single) time in ps
    box - (singlePtr) Box as a 3x3 array
    x - (singlePtr) Coordinates as an 3xnatoms array
    natoms - (int32) Number of atoms in trajectory
    prec - (single) Precision of XTC file

--> FILE: read_trr.m
USAGE: [rstatus,trajstruct]=read_xtc(initstruct)
trajstruct:
    step - (int32) timestep
    time - (single) time in ps
    lam - (single) lambda
    box - (singlePtr) Box as a 3x3 array
    x - (singlePtr) Coordinates as a 3xnatoms array
    v - (singlePtr) Velocities as a 3xnatoms array
    f - (singlePtr) Forces as a 3xnatoms array

--> FILE: write_xtc.m

USAGE: wstatus=write_xtc(initstruct, trajstruct)

wstatus - (int32)

    time - (single) time in ps
    box - (singlePtr) Box as a 3x3 array
    x - (singlePtr) Coordinates as an 3xnatoms array
    natoms - (int32) Number of atoms in trajectory
    prec - (single) Precision of XTC file
	
--> FILE: write_trr.m
