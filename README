%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% USING THE XDRFILE LIBRARY WITH MATLAB %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-- The libxdrfile lib was compiled with the following:

> export MXWORKDIR=$PWD
> cd xdrfile-1.1.1
> ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$MXWORKDIR
> make
> make install

-- The header files for libxdrfile had to be slightly altered with a patch to be loadable into
matlab. The altered files reside inside include/:

>cd $MXWORKDIR
>patch -p0 <headers.patch

-- The thunk library file and the fileheaders.m was created by running the
following command in matlab:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile','xdrfile_xtc.h','addheader','xdrfile_trr','addheader','xdrfile','mfilename','fileheaders.m',...
 'thunkfilename','libxdr_thunk')

The library can then be loaded with:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile',@fileheaders)

%%%%%%%%%%%%% TESTING THE LIBRARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The library read and write functions can be tested by running the included test scripts test_trr.m
and test_xtc.m in Matlab after completing the above install procedure.
