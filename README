%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% USING THE XDRFILE LIBRARY WITH MATLAB %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
INSTALLATION:

> cd my/path/to/mxdrfile
> make

Pay attention to any errors in the make procedure. If needed install required
libraries and/or consult the libxdrfile documentation.

> make test

If all went ok, the library can be loaded in Matlab with:

>loadmxdrfile

or

> addpath(genpath(fullpath('my','path','to','mxdrfile','mxdrfunctions')))
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile',@fileheaders)

%%%%%%%%%%%%% TESTING THE LIBRARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The library read and write functions can be tested by running the
included test scripts test_trr.m and test_xtc.m in Matlab after
completing the above install procedure.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% THE MXDRFILE CLASS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

--> FILE: @mxdrfile/mxdrfile.m

USAGE: trj=mxdrfile(trajfile [,indexfile])

trajfile - (str) Trajectory filename with .trr or .xtc extension
indexfile - (str) OPTIONAL: Gromacs indexfile in .ndx format

CLASS PROPERTIES:

fname - (str) Trajectory filename
ftype - (str) Trajectory filetype (by extension)
fhandle - (1x1 lib.pointer) File handle for the open trajfile
natoms - (int32) Number of atoms in trajectory
status - (int32) Status of trajectory processing, 0=OK
step - (int32) Trajectory step number
time - (int32) Time in ps
lam - (int32) Lambda
box - (1x1 lib.pointer) box as a 3x3 matrix: value [3x3 single]
x - (1x1 lib.pointer) Coordinates: value [3xnatoms single]
v - (1x1 lib.pointer) Velocities (trr only): value [3xnatoms single]
f - (1x1 lib.pointer) Forces (trr only):  value [3xnatoms single]
prec - (int32) Precision of xtc files (default 1000)
ndx - (1x1 struct) If indexfile is given field names are ndx groups: [nx1 int32]

CLASS METHODS

read - read next frame in trajectory
delete - Close trajectory file when the class object is destroyed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OPEN AND CLOSE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
--> FILE: inittraj.m

USAGE: [status,initstruct]=inittraj(fname,action)

fname - (str) Filename of .xtc or .trr file
action - (str) 'r' or 'w' for read or write access. WARNING! 'w' will overwrite fname!!

    natoms - (int32) Number of atoms in trajectory

--> FILE: closetraj.m
USAGE: [status,initstruct]=closetraj(initstruct)
        Warning! Operating on a closed lib.pointer
        file handle may cause segmentation faults. Make sure
        to "pass by reference" using initstruct as both
        input and output when closing trajectories!
