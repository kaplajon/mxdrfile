%%%%%%%%%%%% USING THE XDRFILE LIBRARY WITH MATLAB %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

mxdrfile is a set of wrapper functions for libxdrfile that enables reading and writing Gromacs
trr and xtc trajectory files in Matlab. The Gromacs xdrfile library is loaded 
with the loadlibrary function in Matlab and is tested under Ubuntu 12.04.4 
together with Matlab R2013b.

-- The Gromacs xdrfile lib was compiled with the following:

> export MXWORKDIR=$PWD
> cd xdrfile-1.1.1
> ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$MXWORKDIR
> make
> make install

-- The header files for libxdrfile had to be slightly altered with a patch to be loadable into
matlab. The altered files reside inside include/:

>cd $MXWORKDIR
>patch -p0 <headers.patch

-- The thunk library file and the fileheaders.m was created by running the
following command in matlab:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile','xdrfile_xtc.h','addheader','xdrfile_trr','addheader','xdrfile','mfilename','fileheaders.m',...
 'thunkfilename','libxdr_thunk')

The library can then be loaded with:

> addpath include/xdrfile lib
> loadlibrary('libxdrfile',@fileheaders)

%%%%%%%%%%%%% TESTING THE LIBRARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The library read and write functions can be tested by running the included test scripts test_trr.m
and test_xtc.m in Matlab after completing the above install procedure.
