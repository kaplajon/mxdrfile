	abstract = {A multiscale simulation of a complex between the lac repressor protein {(LacI)} and a 107-bp-long {DNA} segment is reported. The complex between the repressor and two operator {DNA} segments is described by all-atom molecular dynamics; the size of the simulated system comprises either 226,000 or 314,000 atoms. The {DNA} loop connecting the operators is modeled as a continuous elastic ribbon, described mathematically by the nonlinear Kirchhoff differential equations with boundary conditions obtained from the coordinates of the terminal base pairs of each operator. The forces stemming from the looped {DNA} are included in the molecular dynamics simulations; the loop structure and the forces are continuously recomputed because the protein motions during the simulations shift the operators and the presumed termini of the loop. The simulations reveal the structural dynamics of the {LacI–DNA} complex in unprecedented detail. The multiple domains of {LacI} exhibit remarkable structural stability during the simulation, moving much like rigid bodies. {LacI} is shown to absorb the strain from the looped {DNA} mainly through its mobile {DNA-binding} head groups. Even with large fluctuating forces applied, the head groups tilt strongly and keep their grip on the operator {DNA,} while the remainder of the protein retains its V-shaped structure. A simulated opening of the cleft of {LacI} by {500-pN} forces revealed the interactions responsible for locking {LacI} in the V-conformation.},

	abstract = {The tethered particle motion {(TPM)} allows the direct detection of activity of a variety of biomolecules at the single molecule level. First pioneered for {RNA} polymerase, it has recently been applied also to other enzymes. In this work we employ {TPM} for a systematic investigation of the kinetics of {DNA} looping by wild-type Lac repressor {(wt-LacI)} and by hinge mutants {Q60G} and Q60 + 1. We implement a novel method for {TPM} data analysis to reliably measure the kinetics of loop formation and disruption and to quantify the effects of the protein hinge flexibility and of {DNA} loop strain on such kinetics. We demonstrate that the flexibility of the protein hinge has a profound effect on the lifetime of the looped state. Our measurements also show that the {DNA} bending energy plays a minor role on loop disruption kinetics, while a strong effect is seen on the kinetics of loop formation. These observations substantiate the growing OPTnumber of theoretical studies aimed at characterizing the effects of {DNA} flexibility, tension and torsion on the kinetics of protein binding and dissociation, strengthening the idea that these mechanical factors in vivo may play an important role in the modulation of gene expression regulation.},

	abstract = {Gene expression regulation is a fundamental biological process which deploys specific sets of genomic information depending on physiological or environmental conditions. Several transcription factors (including lac repressor, {LacI)} are present in the cell at very low copy OPTnumber and increase their local concentration by binding to multiple sites on {DNA} and looping the intervening sequence. In this work, we employ single-molecule manipulation to experimentally address the role of {DNA} supercoiling in the dynamics and stability of {LacI-mediated} {DNA} looping. We performed measurements over a range of degrees of supercoiling between -0.026 and +0.026, in the absence of axial stretching forces. A supercoiling-dependent modulation of the lifetimes of both the looped and unlooped states was observed. Our experiments also provide evidence for multiple structural conformations of the {LacI-DNA} complex, depending on torsional constraints. The supercoiling-dependent modulation demonstrated here adds an important element to the model of the lac operon. In fact, the complex network of proteins acting on the {DNA} in a living cell constantly modifies its topological and mechanical properties: our observations demonstrate the possibility of establishing a signaling pathway from factors affecting {DNA} supercoiling to transcription factors responsible for the regulation of specific sets of genes.},

The neutron scattering intensity {I(Q)} in the region of scattering vectors Q corresponding to 0.0015 {Å−2≤Q2≤0.0115} Å−2 was fitted using a step function model of bilayer neutron scattering length density and supposing that the liposomes are spherical and have a Gaussian distribution of radii.

Although the functional coupling between {MtCK} and {ANT} has been demonstrated, the precise mechanism of the coupling is not clear. To study the details of the coupling, we turned to molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce a new coarse-grained molecular dynamics model of a patch of the mitochondrial inner membrane containing a transmembrane {ANT} and an {MtCK} above the membrane. The membrane model consists of three major types of lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin) in a roughly 2:1:1 molar ratio. A thermodynamics-based coarse-grained force field, termed {MARTINI}, has been used together with the {GROMACS} molecular dynamics package for all simulated systems in this work. Several physical properties of the system are reproduced by the model and are in agreement with known data. This includes membrane thickness, dimension of the proteins, and diffusion constants. We have studied the binding of {MtCK} to the membrane and demonstrated the effect of cardiolipin on the stabilization of the binding. In addition, our simulations predict which part of the {MtCK} protein sequence interacts with the membrane. Taken together, the model has been verified by dynamical and structural data and can be used as the basis for further studies.},

	abstract = {We studied compositionally heterogeneous multi-component model membranes comprised of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and α-helical {TM} protein models using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Reducing the mismatch between the length of the saturated and unsaturated lipid tails reduced the driving force for segregation into liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) lipid domains. Cholesterol depletion had a similar effect, and binary lipid mixtures without cholesterol did not undergo large-scale phase separation under the simulation conditions. The phase-separating ternary dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine {(DPPC)/dilinoleoyl-PC} {(DLiPC)/cholesterol} bilayer was found to segregate into lo and ld domains also in the presence of a high concentration of ΤΜ helices. The ld domain was highly crowded with {TM} helices (protein-to-lipid ratio {\textasciitilde}\&\#xa0;1:5), slowing down lateral diffusion by a factor of 5–10 as compared to the dilute case, with anomalous (sub)-diffusion on the μs time scale. The membrane with the less strongly unsaturated {palmitoyl-linoleoyl-PC} instead of {DLiPC}, which in the absence of {TM} α-helices less strongly deviated from ideal mixing, could be brought closer to a miscibility critical point by introducing a high concentration of {TM} helices. Finally, the {7-TM} protein bacteriorhodopsin was found to partition into the ld domains irrespective of hydrophobic matching. These results show that it is possible to directly study the lateral reorganization of lipids and proteins in compositionally heterogeneous and crowded model biomembranes with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, a step toward simulations of realistic, compositionally complex cellular membranes.

Previous attempts of developing a model E. coli membrane have used only 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine {(POPE)} and (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol) {POPG} lipids. However, an important constituent of bacterial membranes are lipids containing a cyclopropane ring within the acyl chain. We have developed a complex membrane that more accurately reflects the diverse population of lipids within E. coli cytoplasmic membranes, including lipids with a cyclic moiety. Differences between the deuterium order profile of cyclic lipids and monounsaturated lipids are observed. Furthermore, the inclusion of the cyclopropane ring decreases the surface density of the bilayer and produces a more rigid membrane as compared to {POPE/POPG} membranes. Additionally, the diverse acyl chain length creates a thinner bilayer which matches the hydrophobic thickness of E. coli transmembrane proteins better than the {POPE/POPG} bilayer. We believe that the complex lipid bilayer more accurately describes a bacterial membrane and suggest the use of it in molecular dynamic simulations rather than simple {POPE/POPG} membranes.},

A peristaltic instability appears, with wavelength on the order of the tube circumference, characterized by tautness and suppression of curvature fluctuations in the membrane. We interpret this in terms of a model that includes a surface tension term in the elastic energy, and describes a transition to stable, finite amplitude peristaltic states. At high amplitudes the experiment reveals new dynamic states of "pearls" interconnected via thin tubes along which they travel and aggregate.},
