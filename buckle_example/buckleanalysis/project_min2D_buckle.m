% in both x and z-directions.
%
% fit function: x(i) = x0 + Lx*X(s(i),g);
%               z(i) = z0 + Lx*Z(s(i),g)

% sInit           : initial guess for s parameters (period = 1).
% xx,zz           : fit points to be projected, in the same units as Lx.
% Lx : box-length in x direction, sets length scale of the problem
% output:
