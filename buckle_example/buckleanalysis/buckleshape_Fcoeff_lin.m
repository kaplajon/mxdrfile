%    buckleshape_Fcoeff_lin(s,g,Lx,reRead)
%
% computes the parameterized shape X(s),Z(s) of a buckled periodic rod with
% projected x-length Lx, and compression factor g=Lx/L, where L is the
% total arclength. The parameter s has unit period, but all output are
% given in units of Lx, so that 0<x<Lx when 0<s<1. All partial derivatives
% are also returned.
%
% s can be a matrix, but g and Lx should be scalars. Output is the same
% shape as s (row or column vector).
%
% The curvature along s is given by
%
% C=-(dXds.*d2Zds2-dZds.*d2Xds2)./(dXds.^2+dZds.^2).^1.5;
%
% where the convention is that positive curvature curves away from the
% normal vector, which is in turn pointing upwards:
%
% nx = -dZds/sqrt(dXds.^2+dZds.^2),
% nz =  dXds/sqrt(dXds.^2+dZds.^2).
% 
% reRead : (optional) If true, Fourier coefficients are reread from disk.
